     * <p>
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands
     * <p>
     * 
     * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by
     * water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the
     * grid are all surrounded by water.
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * 11110
     * 
     * 11010
     * 
     * 11000
     * 
     * 00000
     * 
     * Answer: 1
     * 
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * 11000
     * 
     * 11000
     * 
     * 00100
     * 
     * 00011
     * 
     * Answer: 3
