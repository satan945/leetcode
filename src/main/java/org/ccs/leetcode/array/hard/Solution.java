     * 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
     * <p>
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii
     * <p>
     * Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array": What if duplicates are allowed?
     * 
     * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why? Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at
     * some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
     * 
     * (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
     * 
     * Find the minimum element.
     * 
     * The array may contain duplicates.
     * 
     * 
     * </p>
     * 
     * @param nums
     * @return
