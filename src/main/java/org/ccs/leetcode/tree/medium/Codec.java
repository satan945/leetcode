/**
 * 449. Serialize and Deserialize BST
 * <p>
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be
 * stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
 * same or another computer environment.
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your
 * serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be
 * serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 * 
 * The encoded string should be as compact as possible.
 * 
 * Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms
 * should be stateless.
 * </p>
