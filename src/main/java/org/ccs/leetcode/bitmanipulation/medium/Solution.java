     * Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear

     * 89. Gray Code
     * <p>
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code
     * <p>
     * The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
     *
     * Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray
     * code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
     *
     * For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
     *
     * 00 - 0 01 - 1 11 - 3 10 - 2 Note: For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.
     *
     * For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.
     *
     * For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.
