     * 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
     * <p>
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock
     * <p>
     * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
     * 
     * If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock),
     * design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
     * 
     * Example 1: Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4] Output: 5
     * 
     * max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price) Example 2: Input:
     * [7, 6, 4, 3, 1] Output: 0
     * 
     * In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
     * </p>
     * 
     * @param prices
     * @return
     */
