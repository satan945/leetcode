     * 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown
     * <p>
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown
     * <p>
     * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
     * 
     * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one
     * and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
     * 
     * You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
     * After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day) Example:
     * 
     * prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2] maxProfit = 3 transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
     * </p>
     * 
     * @param prices
     * @return
