     * 294. Flip Game II
     * <p>
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game-ii
     * <p>
     * You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters:
     * + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can
     * no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.
     *
     * Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.
     *
     * For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++"
     * to become "+--+".
     *
     * Follow up: Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.
     * </p>

     * @return
