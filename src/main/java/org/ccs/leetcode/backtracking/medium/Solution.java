     * 294. Flip Game II

     * <p>
     * You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters:
     * + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can
     * no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.
     *
     * Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.
     *
     * For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++"
     * to become "+--+".
     *
     * Follow up: Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.

     * Given a set of candidate numbers (C) (without duplicates) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations
     * in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.
     * 
     * The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

     * combinations. For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7, A solution set is: [ [7], [2, 2, 3] ]
