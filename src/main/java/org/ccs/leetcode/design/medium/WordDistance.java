/**
 * <p>
 * This is a follow up of Shortest Word Distance.
 * 
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance
 * 
 * The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly many times with
 * different parameters. How would you optimize it?
 * 
 * Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words word1
 * and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
 * 
 * For example, Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 * 
 * Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3. Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.
 * 
 * Note: You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.
 *
