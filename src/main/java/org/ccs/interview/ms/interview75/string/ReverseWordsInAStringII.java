/**
 * 186. Reverse Words in a String II
 * 
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-ii
 * <p>
 * Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
 * 
 * The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.
 * 
 * For example, Given s = "the sky is blue", return "blue is sky the".
 * 
 * Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
 * </p>
