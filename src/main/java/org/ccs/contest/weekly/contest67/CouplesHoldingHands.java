/**
 * 765. Couples Holding Hands
 * <p>
 * No.4
 * 
 * N couples sit in 2N seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands. We want to know the minimum number of swaps so
 * that every couple is sitting side by side. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch
 * seats.
 * 
 * The people and seats are represented by an integer from 0 to 2N-1, the couples are numbered in order, the first
 * couple being (0, 1), the second couple being (2, 3), and so on with the last couple being (2N-2, 2N-1).
 * 
 * The couples' initial seating is given by row[i] being the value of the person who is initially sitting in the i-th
 * seat.
 * </p>
