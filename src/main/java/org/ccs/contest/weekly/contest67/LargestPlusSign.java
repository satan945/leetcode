/**
 * 764. Largest Plus Sign
 * <p>
 * No.3
 * 
 * In a 2D grid from (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1), every cell contains a 1, except those cells in the given list mines which are
 * 0. What is the largest axis-aligned plus sign of 1s contained in the grid? Return the order of the plus sign. If
 * there is none, return 0.
 * 
 * An "axis-aligned plus sign of 1s of order k" has some center grid[x][y] = 1 along with 4 arms of length k-1 going up,
 * down, left, and right, and made of 1s. This is demonstrated in the diagrams below. Note that there could be 0s or 1s
 * beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for 1s.
 * </p>
