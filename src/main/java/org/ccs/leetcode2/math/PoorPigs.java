/**
 * 458. Poor Pigs
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them contains poison, the rest are filled with water. They all look the
 * same. If a pig drinks that poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to
 * figure out which bucket contains the poison within one hour.
 * 
 * Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the follow-up general case.
 * 
 * Follow-up:
 * 
 * If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out
 * the "poison" bucket within p minutes? There is exact one bucket with poison.
 * </p>
