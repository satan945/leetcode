/**
 * 351. Android Unlock Patterns
 * <p>
 * Given an Android 3x3 key lock screen and two integers m and n, where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 9, count the total number of unlock
 * patterns of the Android lock screen, which consist of minimum of m keys and maximum n keys.
 * 
 * Rules for a valid pattern: Each pattern must connect at least m keys and at most n keys. All the keys must be
 * distinct. If the line connecting two consecutive keys in the pattern passes through any other keys, the other keys
 * must have previously selected in the pattern. No jumps through non selected key is allowed. The order of keys used
 * matters.
 * </p>
