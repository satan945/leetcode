/**
 * 742. Closest Leaf in a Binary Tree
 * <p>
 * Given a binary tree where every node has a unique value, and a target key k, find the value of the nearest leaf node
 * to target k in the tree.
 * 
 * Here, nearest to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree.
 * Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.
 * 
 * In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row. The actual root tree given
 * will be a TreeNode object.
 * </p>
