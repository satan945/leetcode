/**
 * 394. Decode String
 * <p>
 * Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.
 * 
 * The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated
 * exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
 * 
 * You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.
 * 
 * Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those
 * repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].
 * </p>
